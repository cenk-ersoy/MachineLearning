# MachineLearning
This repo contains sample Jupyter Notebooks related to Machine Learning. Detailed explanations are added by me as comments inside the code.
- **catboost.ipynb**: This example is from a Kaggle submisson documented here: https://github.com/mrdbourke/your-first-kaggle-submission/blob/master/kaggle-titanic-dataset-example-submission-workflow.ipynb. It aims to predict churn rate at a bank.
- **cross_validation.ipynb**: This example is from a Udemy course titled "Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Bonus [2023]" by Kirill Emerenko. Based on the user's gender, age and estimated salaray, this algorithm tries to predict if the person will make a purchase.
- **cross_validation_and_grid_search.ipynb**: This example is from "Python Machine Learning Illustrated Guide For Beginners" by William Sullivan.
