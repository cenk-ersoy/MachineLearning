# MachineLearning
This repo contains sample Jupyter Notebooks related to Machine Learning. Detailed explanations are added by me as comments inside the code.
- **catboost.ipynb**: This example aims to predict churn rate at a bank. It is from a Kaggle submisson documented here: https://github.com/mrdbourke/your-first-kaggle-submission/blob/master/kaggle-titanic-dataset-example-submission-workflow.ipynb. 
- **cross_validation.ipynb**: Based on the user's gender, age and estimated salary, this algorithm tries to predict if the person will make a purchase. 
- **cross_validation_and_grid_search.ipynb**: This example uses the wine dataset and Random Forest Classifier.
